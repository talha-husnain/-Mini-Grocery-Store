# -Mini-Grocery-Store
standalone Graphical User Interface (GUI) Java Swing application that can  keep track of mini-grocery sales.
Client Requirements:
I need a standalone Graphical User Interface (GUI) Java Swing application that can 
keep track of mini-grocery sales. Customers will typically buy Fresh Produce like 
meat, vegetables, and fruits, and edibles like canned Foods and drinks. We then will 
issue a bill listing all the brought items with a sum to pay. Occasionally/Optionally 
my grocery store will run promotions and customers need to present us a royalty card 
(and its number) to get 5% discount. This discount will be applicable to the total 
purchase. The application needs to show price before discount, the discount amount, 
and the net payable after discount (if any). We normally don’t offer any other 
discount amounts besides the 5% discount. But in future we may offer bundled 
discount (e.g. we give discounts only if you buy coke and chicken). If bundled 
discount is applied then there will not be additional discount on the total bill. The 
application needs to be easy to extend if I want this feature later. 
Questions:
The questions below are based on the client requirements above. If you made any 
assumptions, please state your assumptions clearly. Justify your assumptions (if any). 
1. Draw UML diagrams such as use case diagram, a complete class diagram, 
and sequence diagrams for the requirement above. Make sure you use correct 
UML symbols. 
2. Apply one design pattern in your design. Reflect it in the complete class 
diagram (as done in question 1). Pick one design pattern from the following: 
Composite, Adapter, Bridge, Façade, Iterator, Observer, Builder, Prototype, 
Singleton. You must justify why you picked the design pattern. 
3. Implement a Java Swing GUI program for the design as per question 1 and 
2. You need to have event handling and interactions. Also make sure the 
UML diagram design and the coding are coherent.
